# Reading time

This extension adds the expected reading time to any Chrome extension and Chrome Web Store documentation page.

The extension will first check if the page contains the ```<article>``` element. Then, it will count all the words within this element and create a paragraph that displays the total reading time.

   - Load your extension locally
   - Open an extension or Chrome Web Store documentation

   Here are a few pages you can open to see how long each article will take to read.
